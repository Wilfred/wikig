# Home Page

Wikig is a blog-influenced wiki.

It's an attempt to give my content a home, in a form that allows
future editing and the publishing of unfinished ideas. It's heavily
influenced by Martin Fowler's notion of a bliki:

Necessary features:

* Markdown formatting (headings, code samples)
* CamelCaseLinks (minimise creation efforts)

Desirable features:

* Plugins (experiment with niche hypertext ideas such as persistent
  links, sidebars, type tags, content categories)
* Visible history
* Live preview
* Expressive, edit-reload PL used for implementation

Undesirable features:

* User accounts, talk pages (single-user model)
* Comments (adds complexity, too temporal, better served by other
  sites)
